This is Massively, a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background
image (with a new parallax implementation I'm testing) and scroll effects (powered by
Scrollex). A *slight* departure from all the one-pagers I've been doing lately, but one
that fulfills a few user requests and makes use of some new techniques I've been wanting
to try out. Enjoy it :)

## Projects

### 1. WatSkud App
The WatSkud App is a social media application designed to allow businesses to control their own marketing. This app was built using FlutterFlow and initially Firebase, but later transitioned to Supabase for a relational database.

#### Features:
- **Account Creation:** Users can create and manage their accounts.
- **Profile Creation:** Users can create profiles and update their profile pictures and display names.
- **Story Posting:** Users can post stories (images or videos) to their friends.
- **Business Posts:** Businesses can create posts (images or videos) in three locations of their choice. Only managers can create posts for each business.
- **Manager Dashboard:** Managers can manage business profile pictures and have their own dashboard.
- **Friend Requests:** Users can send and accept friend requests, which are filtered to avoid showing users with pending invites.
- **Messaging:** Includes one-on-one messaging, group chats, profile picture updates, and group chat name creation.

#### Note:
This project is currently incomplete but showcases significant progress and functionality.

### 2. Trans-Fresco Logistics App
The Trans-Fresco Logistics App is designed to help a logistics company digitize their operations and gain more control over their fleet of trucks. 
Built using FlutterFlow and Supabase, this app leverages advanced technologies like the OpenAI Vision API to streamline data collection and management.

#### Features:
- **Supabase Authentication:** Secure login for drivers and managers using email and password. Account creation is disabled in the app.
- **Odometer Reading:** Uses OpenAI Vision API to interpret and extract odometer readings from images.
- **Trip Management:** Drivers can log trips, including start and end odometer readings. Managers have additional privileges to add trucks and view all trips.
- **Location Tracking:** Tracks the location where odometer readings are recorded.
- **Persistent Local Saves:** Uses Hive for local storage, ensuring trip data and app state are saved even without an internet connection.

#### Note:
This project is currently incomplete but demonstrates a high level of functionality and potential.

### 3. AI-Chatbot for Job Applications and Bookings
This AI-chatbot is built through Python to handle job applications and bookings for a European company.
It leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to interact with users and streamline various administrative tasks.


#### Features:
- **Job Applications:** The chatbot can interact with users to gather information for job applications, prepopulate data from uploaded CVs, and ask additional questions to fill in gaps.
- **Bookings:** Handles scheduling interviews, creating calendar events, and maintaining a record of the interview transcript.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Uses NLP to understand and respond to user queries effectively.

#### Note:
This project is still under development but showcases impressive functionality and is capable of significantly improving the company's operational efficiency.
